### Project 1: Email Spam Filtering

#### Overview
This project involves the design and implementation of an email spam filter using Naïve Bayes and SVM classifiers. Utilizing the ling-spam dataset, you will explore feature selection techniques and compare the performance of different variants of Naïve Bayes classifiers, as well as implement your own SVM-based classifier.

#### Dataset
The dataset used is the ling-spam corpus, which contains emails from the Linguist mailing list, categorized as either legitimate or spam. The emails are pre-processed in various forms and divided into training and test sets.

#### Objectives
- Implement Naïve Bayes classifiers and an SVM-based spam filter.
- Perform feature selection using the information gain metric.
- Evaluate models based on spam precision, spam recall, and latency.
- Analyze the impact of feature selection on classifier performance.

### Project 2: Univariate Linear Regression

#### Overview
This project focuses on univariate linear regression using a synthetic dataset to model a linear relationship between an independent variable x and a dependent variable y.

#### Dataset
A synthetic dataset generated within the project, assuming a linear relationship between the response variable and an attribute.

#### Objectives
- Develop Python code to determine optimal linear regression coefficients using both analytical methods and functions from the numpy.polynomial.polynomial class.
